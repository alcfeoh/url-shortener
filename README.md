# url-shortener
A URL shortener app based on Angular JS and Firebase

Run index.html in a web werver. Config has to be done in scripts/app.js and index.php

index.php, tester.php and .htaccess have to be uploaded to a PHP server.

In my example, www.interstate21.com/s/ is the root of the shortener service
